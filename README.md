# STAT360
A package written in R that is sufficient to answer every statistics related question that is covered in STAT360. One function that accepts a database in txt format and outputs every answers associated with covered topics.

## Covered topics:
- Simple linear regression models; estimation of regression function; estimation of error term variance; normal error regression model.
- Inferences concerning ß1 and ß0; interval estimation of E(Yh)
- Prediction of new observation; confidence band for regression line; ANOVA approach to regression analysis.
- General linear test approach; descriptive measures of linear association between X and Y; diagnostics for predictor variable; residuals.
- Diagnostic for residuals; overview of tests involving residuals; F-test for lack of fit.
- Joint estimation of ß0 and ß; simultaneous estimation of mean responses; simultaneous prediction intervals for new observations; regression through origin. 
- simple linear regression model in matrix terms; least square estimation of regression parameters
- Fitted values and residuals; ANOVA results; inferences in regression analysis.
- Multiple regression models; general linear regression model in matrix terms; estimation of regression coefficients.
- Fitted values and residuals; ANOVA results; inferences about regression parameters.
- Estimation of mean response and prediction of new observation; multiple regression with two predictor variables. Extra sum of squares & its application.
- Tests concerning regression coefficients; coefficient of partial determination; standardized multiple regression models

## Goals and Future improvements
The existing code's main purpose is to automate homework/assignments. Future release will include a web interface using [R Shiny] (https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
